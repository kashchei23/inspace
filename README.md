<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
InSpace is an app that fetches images and video from the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and displays it in a user friendly UI. Each day, a new image or video with a brief description is featured and displayed on the home page.

For past pictures dating as far back as June 16, 1995, click the search button and a gallery will populate with your chosen images. From there you can use the theater view button to expand selected images fullscreen.

The NASA website inspires exploration into space and the unkown, and I wanted InSpace to make you feel like you're already there. I chose to go with a dark background to reflect the darkness of space, along with shades of blue, purple, and orange which are present in many of the photos taken of the galaxy and universe.  The logo itself is a play on that with the word 'In' being surrounded by the primary gradient colors of the app.

It was important that the design of the app be as simple as possible for ease of use. Because the focus of the content was on a single image or video, this media is always positioned at the top of the viewport in full width. I pulled together the layout and color palette in the hi-fi mockup, and here is where the themes of the app became concrete. This was where the addition of the theater view feature was conceived, as I wanted the viewer to be able to appreciate the image/video in fullscreen.

The color palette is meant to mimic some of the colors seen in deep space, with the rounded Hero New typography chosen to evoke a sense of openness and broad scale.

<h2 id="proto"> Prototype </h2>
The app was built using React, vanilla javascript, and SCSS with a mobile first responsive design.  During development, I decided to add a gallery to display multiple images for a ranged search.  I also had the idea to create small dissolve and scale transitions between pages to lessen the jarring switches during navigation.
